# Sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews
The dataset used to perform sentiment analysis was created by Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. 
More information about the Dataset and their papers can be found [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)

## Process
The sentiment analysis performed in this python script employs Naive Bayes Classification technique which uses a Unigram model 
to classify the given movie review. 

Even though more sophisticated classification methods could have been used, this script was written just to verify the 
data shown in the Dataset authors' paper [Thumbs up? Sentiment classification using machine learning techniques](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/sentiment.pdf).
